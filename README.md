Using Models in your application code has benefits even if you're not using the Model-View-Controller pattern:

* Good for [domain driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).
* Helps to make the code self documenting.
* Offers some structure to the data.

BLOXX JavaScript Models are not part of any larger MVC framework. There isn't even much code dedicated to persistence, so you can just use BLOXX models without a database layer if you'd like.

Designed to work in both the Browser (IE9+) and Node.js.
